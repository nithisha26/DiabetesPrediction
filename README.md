<h1>Diabetes Prediction System</h1>
<p>This project is focused on predicting diabetes using various machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately diagnose whether a patient has diabetes based on several input features. 
This can be a valuable tool in the medical field to assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions.</p>
<p>This also involves data preprocessing and data visualization to understand and prepare the dataset for model training.</p>
<p>The algorithms used in this project include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree.</p>
<p>The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are compared to determine the best-performing algorithm for this dataset.</p>
